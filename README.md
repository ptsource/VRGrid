# Virtual Modelling

Virtual modelling is a collective virtual shared space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality and the internet. 
Virtual presentation models can be used to exhibit and visualise final designs. Models are also used as show pieces, for instance as a feature in the reception of a building, a part of a museum exhibition,  scale replicas of historical buildings or even for building virtual gaming structures.

# VRGrid & Virtual reality
### Current version 10 released 10/11/2019 compiled and tested under Windows 10

Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory feedback like haptic. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. Augmented reality systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a smartphone or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images. VRGrid is an XML standard based markup language for representing interactive 3D and 2D with VR support. It includes its own scripting language for software design, and a format support for 3D models. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.

# VRF File format

The VRF format uses standard XML developed by the World Wide Web Consortium along with the Powers & Stephens parsers for XML. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across diferent platforms. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages.

# VRI Image format

VRI image format only displays in VRGrid. VRI image format supports palette-based images (with palettes of 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA colors), grayscale images (with or without alpha channel for transparency), and full-color non-palette-based RGB/RGBA images (with or without alpha channel) converted from PNG or APNG high resolution format.
